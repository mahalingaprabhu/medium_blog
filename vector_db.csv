Index Type,FLAT,IVF_FLAT,HNSW
Description,"Flat or brute-force indexing method that searches all vectors sequentially for similarity.","Inverted File Index (IVF) groups vectors into clusters, reducing the scope of each search.","Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) index builds a multi-layered graph to connect nearby vectors for quick traversal."
Optimal Scenario,"Small dataset and 100% recall rate.","High-speed queries with high recall rate.","High-speed queries, high recall rate on abundant memory resources."
Limitations,"Slows down as data size increases, becoming less efficient for large-scale datasets.","IVF_FLAT is designed for large-scale datasets. On smaller datasets, the overhead of clustering and managing the inverted file may outweigh its benefits.","Constructing the index can be computationally intensive, especially for very large datasets."
Index Parameter,N/A,"nlist: Represents the number of clusters the data is divided into (Values: 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192)","M: The number of links each node has in the graph (Values: 16, 32, 64); efConstruction: Number of neighbors considered when building the HNSW graph (Values: 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512)"
Search Parameter,"Provide metric_type: 'IP', 'Cosine', or 'L2'.","nprob: The number of clusters (partitions) to probe during search (Values: 32, 64, 128, 256)","efSearch (ef): Exploration factor, neighbors explored during search (Values: 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096)"
Constraints,"As the dataset grows, the search becomes slower, especially for very large datasets.","Increasing nlist creates more buckets with fewer vectors per bucket, reducing computation and improving search speed. However, fewer vectors for similarity comparison may result in missing correct results. nlist is based on the dataset size, typically around 4 * sqrt(n), where n is the total number of vectors. Increasing nprobe searches more buckets, which increases computation but improves search precision.",N/A
